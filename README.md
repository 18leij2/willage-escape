# Willage Escape

## Overview
Willage Escape is a GT themed Frogger-like game, developed collaboratively over a semester on Android Studio for the Google Pixel 4 XL. Use the touch controls to maneuver around moving vehicles and traverse across floating logs and lilypads to reach the end destination â€” not Willage!

## Game Manual
- Move by tapping/clicking the arrow buttons
- Customize your name, avatar, and difficulty in the game configuration screen
- Avoid open water and moving vehicles like cars and buses
- Reach the top of the screen to escape from Willage

## Project Setup
This game was developed for the Google Pixel XL. To run and/or edit the game, [Android Studio]([https://mgba.io/](https://developer.android.com/studio)https://developer.android.com/studio) must first be installed with a Pixel 4 XL emulator (a physical Pixel 4 XL will also work). Then, download or clone the repository. Open Android Studio, select `File > Open`, and open the internal child `WillageEscape` folder located inside the cloned external parent `WillageEscape` folder. From there, press the run button to play the game, or edit the scripts through the project window.
